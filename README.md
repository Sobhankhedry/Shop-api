# Shop-api
an exercise for myself to practice more on the ASP .NET WEB API 
it is an Web Api project that User can Register and login then among all the products they can add their product to cart or delete it.

i also used Hashing passowrd and Authentication due to the [**CodeWithAsfend**](https://github.com/codewithasfend/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication) github Repository and it was a great help 
it was for .net5 , now we are .net8 had some trouble but still managed to get out
